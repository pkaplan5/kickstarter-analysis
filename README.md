An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project was initiated to analyze kickstarter project goals against pledged amounts to provide analysis on successful projects for Louise to be able to sucessfully launch a play using kcikstarter.

### Analysis and Challenges: 
The analysis was performed on data provided on goal amounts and pledged amounts for kickstarter campaigns for variosu types of projects. Projects were catergorized by type of project, location, and project outcomes. Analysis was performed by observing the mean, median, and other statistical analysis of successful and failed kickstarter projects by month of the kickstarter lanuch month. No Challeneges occured during this analysis.

### Conclusions


It was observed that Louise should start a theater kickstarter for plays with a goal of less than Â£2000 to be sucessful with a higher success rate in the months of May or June. As the kickstarter campaigns were launched later in the year a downwards trend was observed with a lower sucess rate.

The best possible outcome for Kickstarter campaings were when the goal was within $35,000-$44,999.

One possible limitation fo the dataset is that a data sub-category for genre of plays for campaigns is not provided. The genre may have impacted the success and failure rates for campaigns. 

An additonal analysis of the range between goal and pledged amounts could be performed to provide additional insight into the kickstarter campaigns.
